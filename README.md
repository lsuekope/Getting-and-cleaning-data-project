The file was divided in 4 steps

The first:
  #Creates a test dataset
    #reads each file, renames the columns and bind the dataset

The second:
  #Creates a train dataset
    #reads each file, renames the columns and bind the dataset

The third: 
  #Creates an extra column with the "type" to shown the data origin, merge the train and test datasets,
    #and removes the unnecessary datasets
  
Fourth:
  #Last step ran the analysis and worked with the dplyr package
